[Session I (Day 4)]{.underline}

*Question 1*

Giri et al. (2016) were interested in the capacity of Atlantic salmon
(*Salmo salar*), grown in an aquaculture situation, to deliver high
levels of omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in their
tissues. Specifically, they tested whether several micronutrients (iron,
zinc, magnesium) and coenzymes (riboflavin, biotin and niacin) could
increase the conversion from short- to long-chain PUFA. They used four
treatments, a diet lacking in these micronutrients and coenzymes (T-0),
a diet with normal levels (T-100), and two levels of fortification,
where the enzymes and micronutrients were 300% and 600% greater than
normal (T-300 and T-600).

The experimental units were 1000 L tanks, each containing 24 fish, with
3 tanks for each of the four diets. After 84 days, fish were euthanized
and tissues analyzed. Fish were analyzed individually (the *measurement*
unit), and the data were then averaged to produce a single value for
each of the large tanks. The tank values were used in statistical
analyses, although these data could also have been analyzed by fitting a
nested model with tank nested in diet and individual fish values as the
observations (see Chapter 10).

1.  What is the biological question?

This study was interested in the relationship between micronutrients and
coenzymes in the diet of salmon and the level of PUFA in the tissue of
the animal. Does increasing these in the diet have an effect on the
conversation from short- to long-chain PUFA, which (presumably) makes
better quality salmon.

2.  What is the statistical query (hypothesis or prediction)?

> Is there an effect of diet fortified with micronutrients and coenzymes
> on PUFA levels in salmon tissue?
>
> The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the effect of
> diet on PUFA levels.

3.  What are the factors in this experiment?

> Response variable: PUFA levels in salmon tissue
>
> Predictor variable: Diet

4.  Are these factors fixed or random? Why?

> Diet is a fixed factor. There are four specific levels of diet and no
> attempt to generalize conclusions about any other types of diet.

5.  Write out the linear model that corresponds to this experiment.

> yij (PUFA) = μ (mean PUFA) + αi (effect of diet treatment i) + εij
> (error)

6.  What are the experiment units?

> Experimental units are tanks

*Question 2*

Long and Porturas (2014) examined the effect of multiple stressors on
the performance of a saltmarsh plant that is important for ecological
restoration. The plant, *Spartina foliosa*, can be affected by herbivory
(from scale insects). Saltmarshes are also environments of varying
salinity, and insects do not always cope well with raised salinity. Long
and Porturas asked whether *Spartina* was affected by herbivory in the
same way in places where salinity was higher. To answer the question,
they experimentally removed scale insects or left them intact, on plots
with salinity at ambient levels or elevated. The experiment was repeated
at two sites chosen to be very different in overall elevation within a
marsh in southern California. On each plot, they recorded the senescence
time of *Spartina* shoots (they senesce sooner when damaged by insects).

1.  What is the biological question?

> Is there a relationship between herbivory and performance or growth of
> saltmarsh plants? Does this relationship vary depending on salinity?

2.  What is the statistical query (hypothesis or prediction)?

> There are three effects of interest based on this experiment design:

-   The interaction between salinity and insects on senescence time
    (i.e. is the effect of insect independent of salinity or not and
    vice-versa).

-   The independent effect of insects pooling across all levels of
    salinity on senescence time

-   The independent effect of salinity pooling across all levels of
    insects on senescence time

3.  What are the factors in this experiment?

> Response: senescence time of the shoots
>
> Predictors: scale insects (present or absent), salinity (ambient or
> elevated levels), site (two sites)

4.  Are these factors fixed or random? Why?

> All three predictors are fixed factors. Site is treated as fixed
> factor in this case. Manipulated factors have two specific levels and
> there is no attempt to generalize conclusions about of levels of
> salinity or rates of herbivory. Often spatial and temporal scales are
> random factors, but not in this case. Perhaps this was due to
> financial or resourcing constraints or availability of suitable
> habitat.

5.  Write out the linear model that corresponds to this experiment.

senescence time = mean senescence time + site + insects + salinity +
insects x site + insects x salinity + insects x salinity + insects x
salinity x site + error

6.  What are the experiment units?

> Plot is the experimental unit

*Question 3*

Steiger et al. (2008) studied the Coolidge effect, the decline in
males\' interest in mating with the same female compared to novel
females, using the burying beetle *Nicrophorus vespilloides*. Eighteen
male beetles were presented with the same female beetle four times, and
then a novel female on the fifth occasion. This was a repeated measures
design as the same individual males were repeatedly presented with
females. There was no evidence that physical exhaustion affected time to
mating as a separate control group of males were presented with novel,
unmated females five times in succession, and there was no change in
time to mating. The within-subjects factor was the order of presented
females, and while this could have been treated as a continuous
covariate, we treated it as a fixed factor with five groups. The
response variable recorded on each occasion was time to mating.

1.  What is the biological question (or best guess given the
    information)?

> The biological question in this study was determine if the male
> burying beetles' interest in mating changes if they have been
> presented with the female in the past or if it is novel. The males'
> interest was measured using time to mate as the response variable.

2.  What is the statistical query (hypothesis or prediction)?

> Is there a difference in the time to mate among the mating orders?

3.  What are the factors in this experiment?

> Response variable: time to mate
>
> Predictors: mating order, beetle (18 beetles)

4.  Are these factors fixed or random? Why?

> Mating order is a fixed factor.
>
> Beetle is a random factor nested with mating order.

5.  Write out the linear model that corresponds to this experiment.

> Mating order = mean mating time + mating order + beetle (mating
> order) + error

6.  What are the experiment units?

> The experimental unit is beetle.
