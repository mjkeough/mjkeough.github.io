<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Ch 10 exercises</h1>

</div>


<p>The aim of these exercises is to start getting familiar with mixed
models, and in these exercises we’ll be focused on models with multiple
categorical predictors, with at least one predictor a random effect. The
random effects can be crossed or be nested within other predictors,
creating a nested or multilevel structure.</p>
<p>For each of the examples below, you should follow the sequence we’ve
used previously:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>What is the biological question?</p></li>
<li><p>Is the predictor continuous or categorical?</p></li>
<li><p>Write out the linear model corresponding to this
question.</p></li>
<li><p>What distribution do you expect the response variable to
follow?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the assumptions behind the statistical model you’ll
fit?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Are those assumptions satisfied?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Fit the model</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>How will you assess whether the model fits well?</p></li>
<li><p>Can you detect an effect of the predictor?</p></li>
<li><p>How do you measure the effect?</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>What do you conclude (including any cautions)</p></li>
</ol>
<div id="things-to-look-out-for" class="section level4">
<h4>Things to look out for</h4>
<p>In fitting these models, we’ll need to make the initial checklist
more complex:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>as well as classifying a predictor as continuous or categorical,
think clearly about whether it is random or fixed</p></li>
<li><p>think about the relationship between predictors - are they
crossed (factorial) or nested (hierarchical)? Make sure that your linear
model reflects these relationships!</p></li>
<li><p>When there are random effects, assumptions can be more extensive.
We’re usually interested in the fixed effects, and different fixed
effects can have different assumptions. This is particularly the case
with nested designs.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="crossed-mixed-model-designs" class="section level2">
<h2>Crossed mixed model designs</h2>
<p>Remember from Chapter 10 that these designs are typically used for
two purposes.</p>
<p>Random effects are often used as to reduce background noise in the
data (e.g. randomized blocks designs), where the random effect is of
little intrinsic interest. In a sense, we sacrfice degrees of freedom
from the residual variance, anticipating that the variance attributed to
the random effects will be large enough to make this sacrifice
worthwhile. When you see these designs, it’s a good idea to look and see
if the use of a random effect seems a good decision, e.g. by looking at
blocking efficiency.</p>
<p>In other cases, the random effects are used to estimate how
consistently fixed effects act, by estimating variance in their effects
across, for example, an environmental spectrum.</p>

<p><span class="citation">Walter and O’Dowd (1992)</span> were
interested in testing the hypothesis that leaves of the shrub
<em>Viburnum tinus</em> with domatia (small shelters at the juncture of
veins on leaves) have more mites than leaves without domatia. Fourteen
paired leaves on a shrub of <em>V. tinus</em> were randomly chosen and
one leaf in each pair had its domatia shaved while the other remained as
a control; the number of mites was recorded on each leaf (experimental
unit) after two weeks.</p>

<p><span class="citation">Didiano, Johnson, and Duval (2016)</span>
assessed the effects of rainfall intensity and frequency on performance
of grassland plants in Ontario, attempting to understand potential
effects of future climates. The area is projected to receive much more
summer rainfall than at present. They established a field experiment in
which plants were grown from seeds in pots subjected to one of two
rainfall levels (70 and 90 mm per month) and three frequencies (3, 5,
and 15 days per month). They were interested in whether responses of
plants varied according to whether the plants were moncots (5 species,
though only 4 grew successfully) or eudicots (10, species).</p>
<p>The experiment was done using shelters (see their supplementary Fig
2) that prevented natural rainfall, allowing the researchers to control
water received by the plants. They used 10 shelters, each of which had 6
groups of 18 pots (see their figure S1). Each group received one of the
6 frequency/amount combinations. The 18 pots in each group had one of
the 15 target species, with three pots used to measure soil moisture
levels during the experiment.</p>
<p>For each seedling, they recorded leaf number (which didn’t change
much), plant height, and above- and below-ground biomass at the end of
the experiment. They also calculated a ratio of above:below biomass.</p>
<p>The data are available from <a
href="https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.t6h51">dryad</a>;
the data you’ll use are the first sheet in the Excel file, which you can
import directly, or use Excel to save that first sheet as a csv file. To
make things a little complicated, the data file uses only common names,
while the paper uses formal scientific names. We’ve made our own version
of the file with species names and monocot/eudicot added - it’s <a
href="data/didiano.csv">didiano.csv</a></p>
<p>Let’s keep things simple by focusing on one response variable
(above.ground.biomass) and one species (Big bluestem)</p>

<p><span class="citation">Highfill et al. (2019)</span> examined effects
of two psychostimulants of public health concern (cocaine and
methamphetamine) using <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em> as a
“translational” model species. Translational reflected similarities in
dopamine transport and the overall effects of exposure. Their interest
was in variation in susceptibility to these compounds, so they examined
responses of lines of flies chosen from a large set of inbred lines (the
Genetic Reference Panel). Groups of 5 flies from a line were placed into
test vials and their consumption of sucrose media and sucrose + drug
media recorded after 18 h. There’s a nice diagram of the test vial <a
href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007834.g001">here</a>.
Please look at it before proceeding.</p>
<p>It’s not uncommon to find sex-based differences in consumption, so
they used groups of males and groups of female flies for each line.
Combinations were replicated 10 times.</p>
<p>The final complexity was that they were interested in whether drug
sensitivity changed with time, so they allowed 6 hours for flies to
feed, then ran another trial, followed by more food, and a third.</p>

<p>We’ll approach the analysis of this data set in a couple of ways -
simple and complex. The complex way is an extension exercise for Chapter
12. The keenest of you might like to take on the challenge of specifying
and running this model. Do it after you’ve finished the Chapter 12
exercises, and with reference to Box 12.5.</p>

<h3>Ways to simplify things</h3>
<p>We can also make the main question (variation in sensitivity to a
psychostimulant) more tractable. The stimulant effect is the difference
between sucrose and the drug solution, so we could calculate that for
each vial.</p>
<p>We still have the question of what to do with the three trials
(Exposure).</p>
<pre><code>-   You could jump ahead to Chapter 12 and see whether sensitivity varies with time, and whether that variation varies with line

-   Use the three trials as just a way of estimating sensitivity, i.e. average them

-   Choose one of the trials as &quot;the&quot; endpoint, e.g. Trial 3</code></pre>
<p>For this chapter’s exercises, lets stick with the two simplifications
- calculate sensitivity and average it across trial, and calculate
sensitivity and look at the last trial (Exposure = 3).</p>

<p><span class="citation">Birceanu and Wilkie (2018)</span> examined
potential concerns around the use of 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol
(TFM). This chemical is used to control an invasive species (sea
lamprey) in the Great Lakes of North America. Control is directed at
larval lampreys, and to be effective, it must be applied at relatively
high concentrations. There is a question of risks this may pose to other
fish species. Bircenau and Wilkie focused on physiological effects on
rainbow trout (<em>Oncorhynchus mykiss</em>).</p>
<p>In the data we’ll look at, they focused on sub-lethal,
environmentally relevant concentrations of TFM, and they considered
effects on two pathways involved in detoxification of TFM. The
hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis mediates the stress
response of fishes, and on liver metabolic capacity. Many organisms
detoxify pollutants via the liver.</p>
<p>Physiological measurements were done on individual trout. Fish were
exposed to TFM (or control) for 9h, then stressed for 12h, after which
physiological measurements were taken.</p>
<p>The animal husbandry involved fish being placed in large (180 L)
tanks, with 24 fish per tank. Six tanks were used, and after fish had
acclimatized for 24 h, TFM was added to three of the tanks. After 9h,
all tanks were flushed and fish left overnight. After this time, 6 fish
were removed from each tank and assayed, then fish were stressed (by
chasing them vigorously for 3 min), then 6 more assayed after 1 and 4 h,
then a further 6 sampled after 24h. Their <a

<p><span class="citation">Cramp et al. (2014)</span> examined two
aspects of changing climates, altered levels of UVB radiation and
increased temperatures. Their interest was in the capacity for these
changes to alter physiology (measured as oxygen consumption, VO2) and
susceptibility to parasites (measured as prevalence, i.e. whether
parasites were present, and intensity, the number of parasites present).
They were especially interested in whether UV and temperature acted
independently or synergistically, and they investigated this question
with a small, widely-distributed freshwater fish, <em>Gambusia
holbrooki</em>.</p>
<p>The experiment involved wild-caught fish (from the University of
Queensland campus) that were brought into the laboratory and housed in
2L tanks. There were 40 tanks, each with 15 fish. After initial
acclimitization, tanks were assigned randomly to one of four
combinations of temperature (18 or 25 ℃) and UVB (high and low,
corresponding to a more than 10-fold difference). After 10 days, fish
were challenged with a common pathogen, whitespot, which is an
ectoparasitic ciliate. Fish were left with the parasites for 8 d, after
which the presence or absence of parasites was recorded (prevalence),
the number of parasites counted (intensity), and a measure of each
fishes metabolic rate (as oxygen consumption) taken.</p>
