<p>These exercises will push you a bit to fit GLMs to various kinds of
data. You’ll need to pay attention to the nature of the predictors and
think about the response variables and their likely distributions.</p>
<div id="a" class="section level3">
<h3>A</h3>
<p>Uefune et al (2020) studied the use of synthetic herbivory-induced
plant volatiles (HIPVs) to attract larval parasitoid wasps (<em>Plutella
xylostella</em>) to control diamondback moths (DBM: <em>Cotesia
vestalis</em>), a global pest of cruciferous vegetables. in greenhouses
growing mizuna (Japanese mustard) in Japan. They used two groups of
greenhouses, the treated group having dispensers for the HIPVs as well
as honeyfeeders to attract <em>C. vestalis</em>) and a second untreated
group. In each greenhouse, a single sticky trap, replaced weekly over 6
months, was used to catch both DBMs and <em>C. vestalis</em> and the
numbers of both counted. While greenhouse ID could have been included as
a random effect in a mixed model analysis, the available data did not
record individual greenhouses. We will model numbers of <em>C.
vestalis</em> against numbers of DBM and treatment using each trap as
the units of analysis. The study was done in 2006 and 2008 but we only
analyze the 2008 data.</p>
<p>The data are available on <a
href="https://doi.org/10.%205061/dryad.fqz612jpq">Dryad</a>, and you’ll
want the Excel file Fig3.xls, and within it, the sheet labelled 2008.
Before using it in analysis, you’ll need to tidy up the first few rows.
Alternatively, here’s a simplified version, with three columns,
treatment, moth, and parasitoid.</p>
<div
id="what-distribution-would-you-expect-the-response-variable-parasitoid-to-follow"
class="section level4">
<h4>What distribution would you expect the response variable
<em>parasitoid</em> to follow?</h4>
</div>
<div
id="import-the-data-and-check-the-properties-of-the-response-variable."
class="section level4">
<h4>Import the data and check the properties of the response
variable.</h4>
<p>Hint: Try graphical presentation (possibly including a
transformation) and look at summary statistics</p>
<p><strong>What do you conclude about the response
variable?</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="fit-a-poisson-glm-and-interpret-the-results"
class="section level4">
<h4>Fit a poisson glm and interpret the results</h4>
<p>You should have decided that the data are too skewed to fit a linear
model assuming a normal distribution, and a poisson is a strong
candidate.</p>
</div>
<div id="extension-question" class="section level4">
<h4>Extension question</h4>
<p>A look at the means and standard deviations suggests that the
variance was much larger than the mean, suggesting some overdispersion.
Let’s check for it, and see if we should be concerned</p>
<p>Hint: here’s an R code chunk to do that:</p>
<p><em>presid &lt;- resid(uefune.glm, type=“pearson”)</em></p>
<p><em>ssize &lt;- nrow(uefune1)</em></p>
<p><em>params &lt;- length(coef(uefune.glm))</em></p>
<p><em>disp &lt;- sum(presid^2)/(ssize-params)</em></p>
<p><em>disp</em></p>
<p><strong>Conclusions?</strong></p>
<p><strong>How does your solution work?</strong></p>
<p><strong>For interest(!). you could also compare the results to the
“old” way of transforming response variables closer to normality and
fitting an OLS linear model</strong></p>
<p>Try linear with sqrt transform</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="b" class="section level3">
<h3>B</h3>
<p>Caudill and Rice (2012) examined the effectiveness of methods for
making agriculture and habitat preservation more compatible,
specifically assessing whether protocols for “Biodiversity-Friendly”
coffee growing resulted in positive outcomes for mammals. They compared
four habitats, forest, Bird Friendly® shade, conventional shade, and sun
coffee, and used a combination of Sherman traps and camera traps to
count mammals and assess species richness. Each habitat was represented
by multiple sites, with 23 total sites monitored. At each site, they
also recorded a series of plant habitat variables, such as cover at
canopy, mid- and lower-strata, and ground level, tree basal area. They
were interested primarily in differences between habitats, but also the
role of vegetation characteristics in influencing mammal diversity. We
focus on this latter relationship.</p>
<p>The data were provided as an Excel file through <a
href="https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061%2Fdryad.q5gh6">Dryad</a>,
which needs a little tidying to use in R; two additional header rows,
and some variable names quite long. Use the tidied <a
href="data/caudill.csv">caudill.csv</a> file for convenience</p>
<p>Potential explanatory habitat variables are</p>
<ul>
<li>% canopy cover,</li>
<li>% mid-strata vegetation,</li>
<li>% lower strata vegetation,</li>
<li>% ground cover,</li>
<li>tree basal area (m2/ha),</li>
<li>tree density (number of trees/m2),</li>
<li>tree richness,</li>
<li>tree height (m), and</li>
<li>coffee height (m)</li>
</ul>
<p>Caudill &amp; Rice examined three response variables, Small Mammal
“species density”, which was the number of small mammal species
recorded, medium-large density, and total species density, which
combined small and med-large.</p>
<p><strong>1. Import the data file and have a look at it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Look at the three response variables. What kind of
distribution is most likely for them?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Would you analyse all three response variables?
Why?</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. What checks would you do for the habitat predictor
variables, and what do you conclude from those checks?</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. The authors showed some differences in mammal diversity
between habitat types, but for their regression analysis they ignored
habitat. Are there any additional checks you’d do before
proceeding.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. What is the linear model for species density of small
mammals</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is there any concern about the number of predictors vs number
of data points?</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. Fit this model to the data and assess its fit. What do you
conclude about habitat influences on small mammals?</strong></p>
<div id="now-run-the-analysis-for-large-mammals" class="section level4">
<h4>Now run the analysis for large mammals</h4>
</div>
</div>
<div id="c" class="section level3">
<h3>C</h3>
<p>This exercise expands on the example introduced in Chapter 13, where
Sinclair and Arcese (1995) were interested in the causes (predation or
other) of death of wildebeeste, more specifically whether predation
varied with sex and health of animals. They addressed the question by
examining carcasses, and they cross-classified 226 wildebeest carcasses
from the Serengeti by three variables: sex (male, female), cause of
death (predation, non-predation) and bone marrow type (SWF: solid white
fatty; OG: opaque gelatinous; TG: translucent gelatinous; with the first
indicating a healthy animal which is not undernourished).</p>
<p>We could look at these data in two ways; as we discussed in the
chapter, it is sometimes difficult to identify a clear response variable
in situations like this. At other times, one variable is a clear
candidate.</p>
<p>The data were extracted from the original paper and used in our first
edition. The data file is <a href="data/sinclair.csv">here</a>.</p>
<div id="hint-for-running-analyses" class="section level4">
<h4>Hint for running analyses</h4>
<p>If you’re working with R we’d recommend that you normally just run
our small script libraries.R. In this case, you’ll need to load two
other packages, <em>epitools</em> and <em>vcd</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The 226 carcasses each could be placed into one of 12 cells of a
2 x 2 x 3 table, and we could model the cell count.</p></li>
<li><p>We could make the cause of death our focus, recording its death
as predation or other, and record values for the other two
values.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="write-out-the-linear-model-you-might-use-in-each-case"
class="section level4">
<h4>Write out the linear model you might use in each case</h4>
</div>
<div
id="what-distribution-would-you-expect-to-response-variable-to-follow-in-each-case"
class="section level4">
<h4>What distribution would you expect to response variable to follow in
each case?</h4>
</div>
<div id="start-with-situation-a" class="section level4">
<h4>Start with situation <em>a</em></h4>
<p><strong>What is your first step in fitting the model to these
data?</strong></p>
<p><strong>What are your next steps?</strong></p>
<p><strong>What do you conclude about the lives of
wildebeeste?</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="b-fit-logistic-model-with-death-as-response"
class="section level4">
<h4><em>b</em> fit logistic model with death as response</h4>
<p>There are two kinds of data files that can be used in this case. We
could work with a long file in which every gnu carcass is a record, or
we could use a summary file, where one column of the file contains a
cell count. This second format is what we used for fitting the
log-linear model of part <em>a</em>, so we’ll stay with it.</p>
<p>To run these data with a binary response, we need to do two
things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use a <em>weights</em> option, so the variable <em>gnus</em> in
this case indicates that a record like this occurs several times, equal
to the value of <em>gnus</em> for this record.</p></li>
<li><p>running a glm may require the death variable to be numerical, so
we’ll define a new variable, <em>pred</em> with values 1 if Predation, 0
if Other. We can do that using <em>ifelse</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t do a full analysis here; just start by looking at the fit of
the initial complex model, and see how your results compare to those you
obtained in part a</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="d" class="section level3">
<h3>D</h3>
<p>One of the consequences of inbreeding in animal populations is that
it is thought to increase the susceptibility of individuals to disease.
To assess this Townsend and colleagues (2018) did genetic analysis of
178 crows found across California, and assessed their level of
homozygosity (homozygosity by locus - HL), a measure of how inbred they
were (higher levels of HL = more inbred). They also took blood samples
from the same crows to check for the presence of avian malaria
(<em>Plasmodium</em>), a common disease. They wanted to test whether
higher amounts of inbreeding (higher HL) were associated with increased
probability of having a <em>Plasmodium</em> infection.</p>
<p>The data file is <a href="data/townsend.csv">here</a></p>
<p>**What kind of response variable do we have here?*</p>
<p>Because we are doing a binomial response a simple scatterplot to
check assumptions here is a little pointless, but just in case you do
want to see it, have a crack</p>
<div
id="now-fit-the-generalised-linear-model-plasmodium-intercept-slopehl-with-a-binomial-response-variable."
class="section level4">
<h4>Now fit the generalised linear model, Plasmodium = intercept +
slope*HL, with a binomial response variable.</h4>
<p>Think about how you might check how well the model fits</p>
<p><strong>Examine the results from fitting the GLM and testing the null
hypothesis that the slope of the response to predictor equals
zero.</strong></p>
<p>Determine and interpret the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>y-intercept</p></li>
<li><p>slope of the regression</p></li>
<li><p>z value for main H<sub>0</sub></p></li>

<div
id="from-the-results-above-what-conclusions-would-you-draw-about-the-relationship-between-incidence-of-avian-malaria-plasmodium-and-the-homozygosity-level"
class="section level4">
<h4>From the results above what conclusions would you draw about the
relationship between incidence of avian malaria (<em>Plasmodium</em>)
and the homozygosity level?</h4>
<p><strong>We can actually use this model to determine what the
probability of a bird having avian malaria is if its homozygosity level
is 50%</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is that probability?</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="odds" class="section level4">
<h4>Odds</h4>
<p>We might want to something a bit more meaningful about the
relationship of homozygosity level to incidence of <em>Plasmodium</em>
and express this in terms of the odds of a bird having avian malaria.
Remember that the binomial model uses a logit link function so that it
models the response in terms of log odds (remember the odds are the
probability of having <em>Plasmodium</em> divided by the probability of
not having it). To compute how the odds of a bird having
<em>Plasmodium</em> varies with homozygosity level in R, us
<em>exp(coef(townsend.glm))</em>. You can also generate 95% confidence
intervals on these odds ratios using
<em>exp(confint.default(townsend.glm))</em></p>
<p><strong>What do you interpret from these results about the odds of a
bird having Plasmodium as you increase the homozygosity
level?</strong></p>
<p>You might find it helpful to plot the data as well as examining the
output</p>
