<p>The aim of these exercises is to make sure you’re comfortable with
fitting simple linear models to data and to emphasise the similarity
between regression and “ANOVA”.</p>
<p>For each of the 5 examples below, you should follow the sequence
we’ve used previously:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>What is the biological question?</p></li>
<li><p>Are the predictors continuous or categorical?</p></li>
<li><p>Write out the linear model corresponding to this
question.</p></li>
<li><p>What distribution do you expect the response variable to
follow?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the assumptions behind the statistical model you’ll
fit?<br />
Are those assumptions satisfied?</p></li>
<li><p>Fit the model</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>How will you assess whether the model fits well?</p></li>
<li><p>Can you detect an effect of the predictor?</p></li>
<li><p>How do you measure the effect?</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>What next steps would you suggest?</p></li>
<li><p>What do you conclude (including any cautions)</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>A</h3>
<p>Hostetler et al. (2016) examined the effects of methamphetamine (MA)
on hypothalamic neuropeptides in the brains of laboratory-housed prairie
voles. Individual voles were the experimental units, and there were two
fixed factors. Treatment, representing access to MA or water, was an
experimental factor, crossed with sex (male vs. female), an
observational factor, with five or six voles in each of the four
combinations.</p>
<p>We’ll start with the oxytocin data as the response variable.</p>
<p><strong>Hint</strong>. To help you analyse this data set in R, have a
look at the online version of Box 7.3, which includes some relevant R
code.</p>
<p>Would the same approach work for the ATV response?</p>
</div>
<div id="b" class="section level3">
<h3>B</h3>
<p>Kraskura et al (2021) examined sex-specific differences in the
metabolic responses of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) to three
different temperatures: 9°C (typical), 14°C (current maximum) and 18°C
(climate change scenario). Fish were collected from a hatchery in
British Columbia, Canada, and returned to a research laboratory and held
in outdoor tanks at 9°C. Temperatures were raised slowly to the relevant
test temperature and held for 2 days. Fish were then transferred
individually to a swim tunnel respirometer where critical swim speed was
measured by increasing the water velocity until the fish could no longer
maintain its position in the water column. In addition, the maximum
metabolic rate was also recorded during each trial. The fish were
subsequently euthanized and their sex determined.</p>
<p>Analyze these data to examine the effects of temperature, sex and the
interaction between these two fixed factors on absolute critical swim
speed (cm s<sup>-1</sup>).</p>
<p>Would the same approach work for the maximum metabolic rate
(mgO<sub>2</sub> kg<sup>-1</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>) response?</p>
</div>
<div id="c" class="section level3">
<h3>C</h3>
<p>This exercise is a little more complex, designed to start thinking
about using additional predictors to give a clearer picture of any
signals from predictors of interest, i.e. to reduce background noise in
the data. Two things to note:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We’ll assume you’ve completed the previous two exercises, so
you’re familiar with multifactor models, the questions they answer, etc.
We won’t go through the initial checklist again, but recommend that you
do it anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>We’ll come back to this example in exercises for later chapters
(10, 11, and 13).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The example we’ll use is from Martello et al. (2022), who tested
whether dietary supplements, which are often expensive, can help with
symptoms of osteoarthritis in dogs. Their study was experimental, with
40 dogs with chronic pain symptoms. Dogs were also screened and excluded
if, for example, they had recent surgery, were taking steroidal
medication, etc. The dogs were then allocated randomly to one of two
treatments, a dietary supplement that included glucosamine sulfate and
chondroitin, and a placebo. The study was completely blind, so
administration of treatments and recording of data was done with no
knowledge of what each dog had received. The supplements were
administered for 60 days, and dogs received treatments orally at 2g/10kg
body weight. The treatments are the variable GROUP.</p>
<p>Two response variables were used, both involving scoring of dogs’
behaviour and activity:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Dog owners used a questionnaire, responses to which generated a
value on a 40 point Helsinki Chronic Pain Index, and these assessments
were done at the start of treatment, and after 40 and 60 days. In the
data file, these measures are the variables HCPI, HCP.4 and
HCP.6</p></li>
<li><p>Veterinary assessments were done at the same 3 times. These
assessments were on a 5-point scale reflecting increasing degrees of
lameness. These variables are SEGNI.OA.VET, SEGNI.OA.VET.4,
SEGNI.OA.VET.6</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We won’t deal with them here, but veterinarians also measured a range
of physiological and biochemical variables from a blood sample at 0 and
60 days.</p>
<p>The authors stated that osteoarthritis is affected by a range of
other factors, including sex, body weight, breed, etc., and they also
considered whether other things like desexing, with its hormonal
changes, might be important. They measured several other potential
predictors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sex</li>
<li>Sterilization (Yes/No)</li>
<li>Body weight (PESO.KG)</li>
<li>Breed (RAZZA)</li>
<li>Estimated age (ETA)</li>
<li>Body condition score, which combines all of these to produce a
4-point scale (BCS).</li>
</ul>
<p>The paper is: Martello, E., Bigliati, M., Adami, R., Biasibetti, E.,
Bisanzio, D., Meineri, G. &amp; Bruni, N. (2022). Efficacy of a dietary
supplement in dogs with osteoarthritis: A randomized placebo-controlled,
double-blind clinical trial. PLoS One, 17, <a
href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263971">e0263971</a>, and
the data are in the supporting information (and a copy is <a
href="data/martello.csv">here</a>).</p>
<p>The question of most interest is whether the dietary supplements
result in an improvement after 60 days, and for now we’ll include sex in
the analysis, as there are good grounds for expecting a range of
sex-based differences.</p>
<p>Identify an appropriate model for examining whether the dog’s
condition, as assessed by their owners, after 60 days, depends on
whether a dog received the supplement or a placebo and whether those
results depended on sex of the dog.</p>
<p>Before starting analysis, we’d do a little tidying up of the data
file, to stay consistent with using lower-case for variable names and
doing away with periods, etc. It doesn’t really matter, but it keeps
things tidy. As we read in the data, we’ll also declare a few of the
variables as factors.</p>
<p>Start with boxplots, then fit model and look at residuals</p>
<p><strong>Would including desexing in the analysis improve the model
fit or the conclusions?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Anything else worth checking?</strong></p>
<p>Have a think about the analysis and the experimental design. We’ve
analyzed the dogs’ status at the end of the experiment, and relied on
randomization to keep us away from misleading results. Think about how
you might use the measurements at time 0 to do some additional checks or
analyses. Think of a couple of ways and then investigate them.</p>
<p><strong>For interest, you could try using the body condition score
(bcs) instead of sex and sterilization, as they were chosen by the
authors to play the same role.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Other things to consider</strong></p>
<p>As you work through later chapters, we’ll use this data set to
explore a few other things: 1. See whether body weight plays a role in
the response. Dosage rates were adjusted for body weight, but there are
other considerations around forces acting on joints, etc. 2. Make use of
the 3 measurements on each dog and see if we can see any more subtle
aspects of the response 3. Take a look at the vet data; with only 5
values, it might be better not to try and force it into an analysis that
presumes a normal distribution.</p>
</div>
<div id="d" class="section level3">
<h3>D</h3>
<p>We’ll return to the example from the Chapter 6 exercises, where
Vosteen et al (2016) examined patterns of production of honeydew by
different races of pea aphids (<em>Acyrthosiphon pisum</em>) and how
that attracts ovipositioning hoverflies (<em>Episyrphus balteatus</em>)
to create enemy-free space for the aphids. They measured honeydew
production in response to combinations of aphid races and
native/universal hosts, and treated these combinations as a single
factor.</p>
<p>We could view aphid race and whether the aphids were on their native
host or a universal one. Use the <a href="data/vosteen.csv">modified
data file</a> to see what happens when you separate these factors.</p>
